# Skalkaho

**Simple quote building for contractors who'd rather be building.**

---

## The Problem

You're a contractor. You know your costs, your margins, and your craft. But every quote means wrestling with spreadsheets, calculators, and that one formula you can never remember. By the time you've got the numbers right, you've lost an hour you could've spent on the job site.

## The Solution

Skalkaho lets you build quotes the way you think about jobs—organized by category, with materials and labor broken out, and your markup applied consistently. Change a quantity, the total updates. Adjust your margin, everything recalculates. No formulas. No fumbling.

## What It Does

- **Organize quotes your way** — Group line items into categories (Framing, Electrical, Plumbing, whatever fits the job)
- **Track materials and labor separately** — Know your costs, generate material lists later
- **Apply markup at any level** — Job-wide, per category, or on individual items
- **See totals in real time** — No more "let me recalculate and get back to you"

## Who It's For

Small to mid-sized contractors who:
- Build quotes regularly but aren't spreadsheet experts
- Want professional-looking numbers without the overhead
- Need to adjust pricing on the fly during customer conversations
- Are tired of their current system (or lack of one)

## The Name

Skalkaho Pass is a scenic route through the Sapphire Mountains east of Hamilton, Montana—where this project started. It's a local name for a local tool, built for people who work with their hands.
